# Streamlit_random_forest_model
Build a random forest model to forecast price house on New york, given attributes like "Longitude, lattitude, waterfront, view" etc. This is a well know dataset and can be found at kaggle.com.
Once the model is built, train and save as a pickle file, we use Streamlit,an alternative to Flask, for deploying the  
model as a web service.
We will evantually need to install some packages: Streamlit, sklearn, pandas and numpy.This can be done usinf "pip install package".
